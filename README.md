Heart Disease Detection Project

Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection of heart disease can drastically improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality rates. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on key clinical features.

The project leverages a dataset containing patient health metrics to build a predictive model that can classify individuals as having heart disease or not having heart disease. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable tool to assist medical professionals in identifying high-risk patients early.

Objective

To build a predictive model that accurately identifies patients at risk of heart disease.

To analyze the most critical features influencing the model's predictions.

To ensure the project outputs are interpretable and actionable for healthcare professionals.

Dataset

The project utilizes the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, a widely used dataset for heart disease classification tasks.

Dataset Features:

The dataset includes 13 clinical features that are key indicators of heart disease, such as:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

Serum Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)

Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)

ST Depression Induced by Exercise (oldpeak)

Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)

Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)

Target Variable:

Key Insights

Features such as chest pain type (cp), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), and ST depression (oldpeak) showed strong correlations with heart disease.

Ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting delivered superior accuracy and generalization.

Visualizing model performance using metrics like the ROC-AUC curve provides confidence in predictions.

Results

Achieved an overall accuracy of 92% using the Random Forest model.
